# **App Name**: SolidityForge

## Core Features:

- Code Generation: Generates Solidity code for various smart contract types, such as token contracts, liquidity pools, swap protocols, and DAOs using generative AI as a tool.
- Contract Selection: A user-friendly interface for selecting the desired smart contract type with prebuilt templates and customization options.
- Parameter Input: Allows users to input parameters specific to their smart contract, such as token name, symbol, initial supply, and governance settings.
- Code Preview: Displays the generated Solidity code for review before deployment.
- Remix Integration: Provides a one-click deployment option to the Remix IDE for testing and deployment.
- Error Prevention: Utilizes AI to analyze user inputs and provide suggestions for error prevention and code optimization. LLM used as a tool.
- Smart Contract Interaction: Can search for required smart contracts and read, write, edit and modify any deployed smart contracts in real time for a fresh deployment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Space Green to convey trust and stability, suitable for blockchain-related applications.
- Background color: Space Black , providing a neutral backdrop that ensures legibility and reduces eye strain, especially when viewing code.
- Accent color: Fire Red, for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons, adding a sense of clarity and modernity.
- Body text and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that provides a modern, objective, neutral look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying Solidity code snippets.
- Use minimalistic and geometric icons to represent different contract types and functions.
- A clean, modular layout with clear separation of sections for code generation, parameter input, and code preview.
- Responsive single screen one page dashboard.
- High end animations for the sections, cards, tabs and background.  GSAP animations, border light effect, hover effect to turn the interface into a masterpiece.
